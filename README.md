#### Description:
* Many avid readers out there find it difficult to manage a record of the books theyâ€™ve read and the pile of books in their TBR list.
* A lot of readers have a habit of reading multiple books at once and it becomes a mess if bookmarks are not used appropriately, which is a hassle really!
* We often find motivational quotes while reading books and it becomes difficult to find that one really good quote from a 500-ish paged book.

<br>My project tries to handle all these problems and saves you the trouble of handling all those bookmarks and lists.

## Tech and files :
This project was created using Django and I made extensive use of Django class based views. Class based views are very powerful and have got built in methods and views to eliminate redundancy for common use cases.
